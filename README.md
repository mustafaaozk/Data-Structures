# **Data Structures**
## Why are data structures important?
---
In computer science, a data structure is a form of data organization and storage usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships between them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, an algebraic structure for data. Typical base data types, such as integers or floating-point values, that are available in most computer programming languages are generally insufficient to capture the logical intent for data processing and use. Yet applications that ingest, manipulate and produce information must understand how data should be organized to simplify processing. Data structures bring together the data elements in a logical way and facilitate the effective use, persistence and sharing of data. They provide a formal model that describes the way the data elements are organized.
